<h6>Developer: Rohit Games</h6>

<h1>About the game</h1>
    <p>Riot Games’ fabled tactical shooter “Project A” had its first official announcement in October 2019, and it was only after a few months that the name Valorant was finally attributed to it.<br>
The League of Legends developers had taken inspiration from other popular first-person shooters like Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to create their very own take<br> 
on the low-TTK shooter genre. <br>
        Valorant had an incredibly successful closed beta launch in April 2020, and an even bigger official release on the 2nd of June.

    <h2>Platforms available and how to get it:</h2>

    

<div class="about">
<p> Though there have been discussions on Valorant coming to console, and getting its very own<br>
            mobile version, the shooter is still firmly “PC only”.<br>

    To download the shooter on any system, players must first head over to the Valorant website and click<br> 
    <h4><a href="https://playvalorant.com/">'Play Now'</a></h4> 
    Now there will be a “sign-in” and a “create a new Riot Games account” option.<br>
    
    League of Legends or Legends of Runeterra players can just sign in with their<br> 
    existing accounts, and for others creating a new one will be mandatory.<br>
    
    After signing into their account players can just click on “Download” on the<br>
    landing page and run the 'Install VALORANT .exe' file to start the process.<br>
    
    It’s important to keep in mind here that along with the game the anticheat<br>
    Vanguard will also get installed, and players will not be able to run Valorant without it.<br>

    Vanguard is a very intrusive and aggressive anti-cheat software that dishes<br>
    out permanent HWID bans to hackers.<br><br>

<h2>The Gameplay</h2>

<div class="about">
<p>
Much like CS: GO, Valorants base gameplay revolves around the Search and Destroy formula where<br>
matches are 25 rounds long, with each round lasting 100 seconds. The team who reaches 13 wins<br> 
first with a two-round lead wins, otherwise, a 12-12 score will lead to overtime. Each round will allow<br>
players 30 seconds to buy weapons and defensive gear for that round, however, unlike CS: GO the<br>
twist in Valorant is that it comes with Agents. And instead of investing in utilities like Smoke grenades<br>
and Molotovs, players will need to purchase Agent abilities. Rounds in Valorant are won when one<br> 
team wipes out the other before the clocks run down, or if the attackers secure a successful plant<br> 
and a blast out of the Spike, or if the defenders can protect the plant sites long enough for the timer<br> 
to run out, or defuse the Spike post-plant.

<h2>The Roles</h2>
<br><br>

<div class="about">
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Duelists: These agents excel in one-on-one combat and are usually equipped with abilities that allow them to close in on enemies and deal damage quickly.<br>
                Examples of Duelists include Jett and Phoenix.</li>
            <li>Controllers: These agents specialize in affecting the battlefield and creating confusion among the enemy team. They typically have abilities that can obscure vision or disrupt enemy movement.<br>
                Examples of Controllers include Viper and Breach.</li>
            <li>Sentinels: These agents have abilities that are focused on defense and utility. They often have abilities that can heal or revive allies, or create barriers to slow down the enemy team.<br>
                Examples of Sentinels include Sage and Cypher.</li>
            <li>Initiators: These agents are often equipped with abilities that can quickly open up a space for their team to attack or defend. They often have abilities that can clear out areas or create distractions.<br>
                Examples of Initiators include Brimstone and Sova.</li>
        </ol>

         </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;">JETT<br>
            Jett has one of the highest skill ceilings in Valorant because her kit focuses more on mobility than utility.
            She excels in 1v1 combat, skirmishes, and flanking due to her outplay potential.
            Her high risk, high reward playstyle can allow her to take over a match but she can also be a liability in the hands of an inexperienced player.<br></p>

         </div>

         <p style="text-align: center;">REYNA<br>
            Reyna is a vampire whose abilities are fueled by kills.
            What she lacks in utility is made up for by her raw killing power.
            She can inflict Nearsight on her enemies, heal herself, turn intangible, and even turn invisible.
            As a result, she’s one of the best duelists and skirmishers in the game.<br></p>

         </div>

         <p style="text-align: center;">PHEONIX<br>
            Phoenix is an explosive pyromancer who excels at initiating combat for his team.
            He can use his flames to not only manipulate the battlefield, but also heal himself.
            With a ton of offensive options, he's one of the best 1v1 fighters among the Valorant agents.<br></p>

            </div>

            <p style="text-align: center;">ASTRA<br>
            Ghanaian agent Astra is a literal unearthly force that has to be reckoned with in every situation of combat going forward.Both defensively as well as offensively Astra provides a large variety of strengths but technically she belongs to the Controller class within Valorant.She is the most complex but also potentially the most powerful agent in the game so far.<br></p>

            </div>

         <p style="text-align: center;">OMEN<br>
            Omen is an agent that thrives by operating in the shadows, using trickery and misdirection to dominate his opponents.
            His projectile abilities can be fired through terrain, allowing him to blind and deceive his enemies from unique angles.
            With two different teleportation abilities, he's able to slip through cracks for a flank or escape from the clutches of death where other agents could not.<br></p>
